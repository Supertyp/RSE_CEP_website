# Bower Roadmap

Deferred framework improvements and the triggers that make each one worth picking up. This file is not loaded into context by default — it's a canonical home for ideas that are named but not scheduled.

Each item has a one-line description and a *revisit trigger*: the signal that turns it from deferred to worth doing.

## Deferred items

- **`/bower-adopt` for brownfield** — A command that reverse-engineers a `docs/` skeleton from an existing codebase with no prior Bower adoption.
  *Revisit trigger:* after first real-project use of Bower v0.3.

- **Retirement lifecycle and `♻️` marker** — A convention for what happens to features that are removed or abandoned (keep `plan.md` as historical record, move under `modules/<m>/retired/`).
  *Revisit trigger:* when a project first retires a feature.

- **`architecture.md` splitting for scale** — Keep `architecture.md` as a short overview; push component-level detail into module-scoped architecture docs.
  *Revisit trigger:* when any project's `architecture.md` passes ~500 lines.

- **CLAUDE.md tiering via `_bower/conventions.md`** — A short core CLAUDE.md with non-negotiables, plus an on-demand `_bower/conventions.md` loaded by the commands that need it.
  *Revisit trigger:* when CLAUDE.md passes a size budget to be set.

- **Constitution template and archive rules** — A schema for `constitution.md` and explicit rules for what belongs in `_bower/archive/`.
  *Revisit trigger:* before second real project.

- **Version migration conventions** — The version marker itself is resolved (CLAUDE.md header carries it, auto-loaded). What's missing is a convention for how an adopting project migrates between Bower releases (e.g., v0.4 → v0.5): what changes, who runs it, how CLAUDE.md customisations are preserved.
  *Revisit trigger:* when a real adopting project first needs to cross a Bower version boundary.

- **Durable-ephemeral proposals on disk** — `docs/proposals/<slug>.md` written at the gate, deleted on completion, to survive session boundaries.
  *Revisit trigger:* if session-boundary pain shows up after first real use.
